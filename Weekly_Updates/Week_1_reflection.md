## Overview

I began refreshing and reviewing chemistry this week. My goals were to understand my learning pace and estimate the amount of time needed to achieve my objectives. I wanted to start with material I am familiar with and comfortable reviewing. Additionally, I hoped to gain a better understanding of how to manage my work-study balance effectively.

## Chapter 1 - Matter: Its Properties and Measurment

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- The Scientific Method
- Properties of Matter
- Classification of Matter
- Measurement of Matter: SI (Metric) Units
- Density and Percent Composition: Their Use in Problem Solving
- Uncertainties in Scienific Measurements
- Significant Figures

**Reflection:**

This chapter contained a lot of important fundamental information. Reviewing it helped me reframe how I view the scientific method. While reading, I realized I have developed the bad habit of forming paradigms and making assumptions without performing experiments or cross-referencing peer-reviewed literature. This reflection has helped me reconsider the difference between what I believe and what is closer to the truth. I will try to be more conscious of when I am making an assumption and what implications it might have.

## Chapter 2 - Atoms and the Atomic Theory

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Early Chemical Discoveries and the Atomic Theory
- Electrons and Other Discoveries in Atomic Physics
- The Nuclear Atom
- Chemical Elements
- Atomic Mass
- Introduction to the Periodic Table
- The Concept of the Mole and the Avogadro Constant
- Using the Mole Concept in Calculations

**Reflection:**

This chapter helped me better understand atomic masses. I was already aware that atomic mass is a weighted average of the isotopes’ masses, but I had not realized that isotopic composition can vary in different locations on Earth. Upon further reflection, I realized this is something I had learned before but had not thought deeply about. I also recalled that in biological systems, Carbon-12 is preferred, but there is a constant input of Carbon-14 from food. This comparison helped me understand that isotope ratios can vary depending on location, which is an important detail to keep in mind.

## Chapter 3 - Chemical Compounds

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Types of Chemical Compounds and Their Formulas
- The Mole Concept and Chemical Compounds
- Composition of Chemical Compounds
- Oxidation States: A Useful Tool in Describing Chemical Compounds
- Naming Compounds: Organic and Inorganic Compounds
- Names and Formulas of Inorgainc Compounds
- Names and Formulas of Organic Compounds

**Reflection:**

This chapter provided a lot of important information about compounds, their names, and oxidation states. I found the review of oxidation states particularly helpful, as it refreshed my understanding of how and why certain bonds are formed. It also clarified how to name binary compounds (metal/nonmetal) and determine what belongs in parentheses, a topic I had not fully grasped in past courses. Overall, this chapter offered valuable review of fundamental topics that will be important in my future studies.

## What I Learned About Myself as a Learner

My initial plan was to transcribe all handwritten notes at the end of each week, but I found the transcription process longer and more tedious than expected. Spending too much time formatting notes can be distracting from the actual learning. To address this, I will upload handwritten notes immediately and, after three to four weeks, dedicate time to transcribe and review them. This approach will create built-in spaced repetition, separating initial learning from later review and strengthening recall while minimizing distractions during study.
