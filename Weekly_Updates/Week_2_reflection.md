# Week 02 - Chemistry, Math, and Software Review

**Date:** 11-12-2025

**Focus Areas:**

- General Chemistry *Principles and Modern Applications* - Petrucci et al., 11th ed.
- Single Variable Calculus Early Transcendentals - James Stewart, 6th ed.
- ACD/ChemSketch Tutorial
- Python Documentation

---

## Overview

I diversified my studying this week and improved my workflow. I was able to increase my recall of previously learned topics while also developing familiarity with software and tools I will need in the future. I feel that this will help improve my overall productivity and strengthen the foundation of my long-term study habits.

## Chemistry

### Chapter 4 - Chemical Reactions

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Chemical Reactions and Chemical Equations
- Chemical Equations and Stoichiometry
- Chemical Reactions in Solution
- Determining the Limiting Reactant
- Other Practical Matters in Reactions Stoichiometry
- The Extent of Reaction

**Reflection:**

This chapter covered material I am fairly comfortable with, so I only wrote a few notes. The most helpful review was the section on chemical dilutions, since I am more familiar with biological dilution calculations. I also benefited from doing a limiting reactant practice problem, as it has been a while since I last worked on one. Ultimately, this chapter provided a solid review and helped me recall important concepts needed for future chapters.

### Chapter 5 - Introduction to Reactions in Aqueous Solutions

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- The Nature of Aqueous Solutions
- Precipitation Reactions
- Acid-Base Reactions
- Oxidation-Reduction Reactions: Some General Principles
- Balancing Oxidation-Reduction Equations
- Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
- Stoichiometry of REactions in Aqueous Solutions: Titrations

**Reflection:**

This chapter was extremely helpful in improving my understanding of oxidation–reduction reactions. One question the textbook did not address was how to determine whether a reaction occurs under acidic or basic conditions. After a simple Google search, I learned that you can often make an informed guess based on common reactants and products. The review of balancing oxidation–reduction equations was also very helpful, since the process differs from balancing ordinary chemical equations.

### Chapter 6 - Gases

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Properties of Gases: Gases Pressure
- The Simple Gas Laws
- Combining the Gas Laws: The Ideal Gas Equation and the General Gas Equation
- Applicaitons of the Ideal Gas Equation
- Gases in Chemical Reactions
- Mixtures of Gases
- Kinetic-Molecular Theory of Gases
- Gas Properties Relating to the Kinetic-Molecular Theory
- Nonideal (Real) Gases

**Reflection:**

Although gas laws are straightforward, thinking through them in more detail made them more intuitive. One of the most interesting sections discussed more complex models used to predict how real gases behave—specifically the van der Waals equation. I found it interesting that this model accounts for both the finite volume of gas molecules and the intermolecular forces between them. This chapter also corrected a misunderstanding I had about standard temperature and pressure: I used to think of STP as “normal” conditions ($`\pu{20 ^{\circ} C}`$, $`\pu{1 atm}`$) rather than the formal values ($`\pu{273.15 K}`$, $`\pu{101.325 kPa}`$).

## Calculus

### Chapter 3 - Differentiation Rules

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Derivatives of Polynomials and Exponential Functions
- The Product and Quotient Rules
- Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
- The Chain Rule
- Implicit Differentiation
- Derivatives of Logarithmic Functions

**Reflection:**

It has been a long time since I last studied calculus, so this chapter was valuable in helping me recall the basics of differentiation. I noticed that some background knowledge—such as types of functions and their relationships—was difficult to recall. I plan to review these concepts next week while continuing to strengthen my understanding of differentiation. Most importantly, I need to work through a set of practice problems.

## Python

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- An Informal Introduction to Python
- More Control Flow Tools
- Classes

**Reflection:**

I learned a lot of foundational material this past week, but what I need most now is to apply what I have learned. I want to become comfortable using the standard library and move beyond simple command-line programs. My long-term goal is to learn how to work with documents (CSV, TSV, Excel, TXT, etc.) and produce visual outputs such as graphs or simple simulations.

## ChemSketch - Section 1 - 4.3

**Concepts Reviewed:**

- Basics of ACD/ChemSketch
- Drawing Simple Structures
- Drawing Complex Structures

**Reflection:**

Working through the first few tutorial sections gave me enough foundational knowledge to create most of the simple compounds I will encounter during the early stages of my chemistry review. I learned how to navigate the interface and identify the functions of various icons. I still need to learn additional features—especially those related to drawing inorganic or non-organic structures—but this week increased my confidence in my ability to learn ChemSketch effectively.

## What I Learned About Myself as a Learner

I learned that I do better when I attempt to solve problems independently with minimal guidance. Once I have a general outline of how a problem can be approached, I prefer to work through it myself, analyze what went wrong, and refine my reasoning until I arrive at an answer I feel confident about. Only then do I compare my solution to the worked example. This approach helps me learn more deeply and identify gaps in my understanding.

- Improve my understanding of Python: keywords, lamdba functions, arguments for functions, and generator functions
- Improve on and separate my mini-project for application and integration of Python knowlegde
- Complete ACD/ChemSketch Tutorial sections 4.4-6
