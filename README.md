# Chemistry and Materials Science Transition Learning Journey

This repository will document my self-directed transition, and growth over time, from microbiology to chemistry and materials science. It contains my notes of new material, weekly reflections, review and the entire process of integrating my knowledge to complete projects for my portfolio.

I plan to continue updating this repository regularly until I begin graduate school applications in 2028\.

---

## My long term goals for this Repository:

- To fill any knowledge gaps, and gain experience in preparation for 2028 graduate school applications\.
- To build a strong foundation in general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry, and essential mathematics and programming.
- To demonstrate discipline, consistency, and dedication to learning about chemistry and materials science through regular reports.
- To prepare myself for joining a research lab, for long\-term hands\-on experience in a lab.
- To create a transparent record of my progress for mentors, professors, and admissions committees.

## Repository Structure

### **Weekly\-Updates/**

Weekly summaries of what I have studied, my reflections of the topics, and goals for the next week.

### **Notes/**

Contains the transcribed and organized notes from topics that I have reviewed or learned in the past week. Also contains references to any textbooks or practice problems sets that were used.

### **Projects/**

Contains ongoing and completed projects to test my understanding and integration of new material.

### **Structures/**

Contains images of chemical structures that are in my notes. The structures are made using ACD/Labs ChemSketch Freeware.

## Note-Taking Workflow

To maintain a consistent learning pace and avoid spending excessive time on formatting during the studying phase, I am currently using a two-step workflow for my notes:

1. **Learning Phase — Raw Handwritten Notes**
   - During active study, I take handwritten notes and upload them directly as images.
   - These raw notes capture my real-time thought process and allow me to stay focused on understanding the material rather than formatting.

2. **Review and Transcription Phase (every 3–4 weeks)**
   - After several weeks, I return to previous topics to transcribe the handwritten notes into organized Markdown files.
   - During transcription, I apply proper formatting, add LaTeX for math, redraw chemical structures using ChemSketch, and clean up explanations.
   - This creates built-in spaced repetition, reinforcing what I learned and improving long-term retention.

This workflow allows me to:
- Build mastery through repeated exposure to the material  
- Improve my technical note-taking skills gradually (LaTeX, markdown structure, ChemSketch)  
- Maintain transparency in my progress and thought process  
- Show growth in the clarity and organization of my notes over time  

As the project develops, the raw handwritten notes will be paired with polished, structured digital versions to show both learning and refinement.
